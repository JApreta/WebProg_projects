# WebProg_projects
Those are some projects from my csc337 course.
The Quotation project uses the database quotes.sql database file, and the finalproject uses the university.sql file.
I worked with the XAMP server and mariadb in both of them.
In the Quotation project, the quotes.php is the homepage--> this is a small project that simulates a quotation service that allows the user to register and login in to the page as well as view, insert, flag/unflag and rate some quotes from the database. User can only unflag quotes after login.
FinalProjects is grade-checker website for students and professor, users can register as students or professor. when  users login as students, they can check their grades for the courses they are enrolled in, and when they enroll as professor they can upload/update grades for students.
